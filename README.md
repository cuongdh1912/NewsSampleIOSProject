An iOS app which shows news according to APIs in https://newsapi.org
- Headline screen: shows all headline news of us in bussiness
- News screen: shows news an area: bitcoin, apple, earthquake, animal.
- Profile screen: user registers his information.

Technique:
- RxAlamofire: calling API request(get, post)
- Kingfisher: loading image
- Autolayout with NSLayoutContraint in storyboard.
- Paging data on table view in API querying.
Need improving:
- Load more button should be disable during query API request.
- Prefetching in loading data in table view
